# Budgeting-App
A full-stack personal budgeting app with a FastAPI backend hosted on an Ubuntu server and a Flutter Android client. Tracks expenses, income, and category-based summaries with secure REST APIs and a clean mobile UI. Built publicly as a personal project to learn full-stack app development and deployment.

Stack: Kotlin, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu

I'm building this app because I do not want to pay at all to track my finances, nor my taxes and I wanted to have a nice little project where I show my frontend and backend skills.
